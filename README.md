# :postbox: About Me
I'm studying CS @ UW <br/>
My experience with coding began when I was ~9 Y/O with [code.org]([url](https://code.org/)). Ever since then, I've been working on random projects for fun, such as websites instead of Google Slides for classes and Mods for Minecraft Servers. Now I'm write react components and tinker with ML.
