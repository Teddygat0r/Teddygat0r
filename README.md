# :postbox: About Me
I'm a computer science student @ the University of Washington.
My experience with coding began when I was ~ 9 Y/O with [code.org]([url](https://code.org/)). Ever since then I've been working on random projects for fun, such as websites instead of Google Slides for classes and Mods for Minecraft Servers.
